A Django application to track time for employees in a small business environment.

# Basic Development Environment
The following deployment setup is only meant as an example for those wishing to quickly get started with development on this application without necessarily understanding the code.

You'll need the following installed before cloning the source code:
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PIP](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html)

Now you're ready to get the code.

- Clone this project using [your favorite Git client](http://sourcetreeapp.com/)
- From the Command Line at the root of the cloned source, execute `pip install -r scripts/reqs.txt`

That's it! Now you have Django along with all the other project dependencies, so your environment is all setup and ready to rock!

# Getting Started with Development
You can modify the source code using one of your favorite Python [editors](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). If you're not familiar with Python or Django, take a look at their Getting Started pages [here](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) and [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/).

Or, if you find reading boring, here's a quick reference of some Django commands you can use with this project from the root of the cloned source:

- `python manage.py migrate`
- `python manage.py runserver`
- `python manage.py test`
